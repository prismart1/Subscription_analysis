Subscription Project

Welcome to the Subscription Project! This project is designed to help you analyze and manage subscription-related data efficiently using Python. Whether you're a data enthusiast or just exploring subscription analytics, this project is a great starting point.

## Project Overview
This Jupyter Notebook contains code that processes and analyzes subscription data to generate insights. It is an interactive tool to help you manipulate data, perform calculations, and create meaningful visualizations. While the code handles the heavy lifting, this README will guide you through how to set up and run the project.

## Features
- Data Analysis: Processes subscription datasets to extract meaningful insights.
- Interactive Exploration: Modify the notebook as needed to suit your data analysis goals.
- Python-Powered: Leverages Python libraries like `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation.
- Customizable: Flexible to accommodate different datasets and use cases.

## Requirements
Before you get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python: Version 3.11.7 or higher
- Dependencies:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`S
  - `seaborn`
  - Other libraries as specified in the notebook (you can install them with `pip` when you run the notebook).

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. Clone the Repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:
   ```bash
   cd subscription-project
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:
   If there is a `requirements.txt` file, you can install all dependencies with:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   Otherwise, manually install any missing libraries when prompted while running the notebook.

4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Subscription\ proj.ipynb
   ```

5. Run the Notebook:
   - Open the notebook in your browser.
   - Run each cell step-by-step to execute the analysis.

## Example Workflow
1. Import your dataset (e.g., a CSV file of subscriptions).
2. Explore the data using summary statistics and visualizations.
3. Apply filters, aggregations, or transformations as needed.
4. Save the processed data or generate reports.

### The amazing contents of the notebook-
- Check for Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset.
- Data Overview: View a summary of the dataset, including key statistics and first few rows.
- Bar Plot: Visualize churn and no churn data with a bar plot.
- KDE Plot: Analyze the distribution of monthly charges with respect to churn.
- Histogram: Plot tenure data and its relationship with churn.
- Data Type Checking: Inspect and convert data types as necessary for accurate analysis.
- Correlation Matrix: Calculate and plot a heatmap to visualize correlations between variables.
